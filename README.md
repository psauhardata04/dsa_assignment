This repository is created for the completion of Assignment 2 of Data Structures and Algorithms (COMP 202).
All programs are written in C language and cover important DSA topics taught in class.

Programs Included

prog_1.c
Program to check whether a given mathematical expression has balanced parentheses using a stack.

prog_2.c
Program to convert an infix expression into postfix and then evaluate the postfix expression.

prog_3.c
Program to perform reverse traversal of a linked list.

prog_4.c
Program to implement a doubly linked list with basic insert and delete operations.

prog_5.c
Program to represent an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix and perform BFS and DFS traversal.

prog_6.c
Program to construct min heap and max heap from an unsorted array.

prog_7.c
Program to find the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

prog_8.c
Program to generate random numbers and sort them using a user-selected algorithm:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

The program also displays the number of comparisons and swaps.

1.Folder Structure

Each program folder contains:

prog_x.c – the C source code

doc_x.md – documentation explaining the program and algorithm

2.Software Requirements

Language: C

Compiler: GCC / Turbo C

Operating System: Windows or Linux

3.How to Run the Programs

Compile the program:

gcc prog_x.c -o prog_x

4.Run the program:

./prog_x
